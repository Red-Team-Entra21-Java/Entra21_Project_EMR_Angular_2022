## **üè• About the project**

O EMR √© um sistema de prontu√°rio eletr√¥nico que tem por finalidade tratar da gest√£o de pequenas cl√≠nicas e consult√≥rios de atendimento m√©dico.

Focado na gest√£o de prontu√°rios eletr√¥nicos, √© capaz de armazenar e gerenciar as informa√ß√µes relativas aos pacientes durante os ciclos de atendimentos. Com o hist√≥rico √© poss√≠vel ao profissional de sa√∫de conhecer as pessoalidades do quadro do seu paciente e assim tomar melhores decis√µes.

Outro ponto importante est√° relacionado a emiss√£o de documenta√ß√£o impressa, assim anulando a possibilidade de erros causados com problemas de interpreta√ß√£o de caligrafia.

        <b>&nbsp; Start</b>
    </summary>

# üè•&nbsp; Start

This is the set of home pages, consisting of the home, login and user registration.

![EMR_initial](./readme_images/emr_start.gif)

## **Home**

The initial pages try to show a harmonic layout, using colors related to the health environment.
Through the home pages it is possible to navigate to the login, user registration, about and contact sections.

In the construction of the initial pages, the technologies of HTML, CSS and TS were used, through the Angular framework.

## **Login**

In the logic used in the login component, we have a page that is capable of re-rendering two components, which may or may not be called based on a defined business rule to identify whether there is a default login or registration of a new user.

In the login component there is a complete logic developed to validate attempts to enter the system. The component has a method capable of communicating with the backend and verifying the users registered in the database (MySql). Once the communication has been carried out, there is a method that verifies the inputs and allows or not the users to enter the system.

If so, the component sends to the service responsible for the system a boolean that says if there is an active login and for a string variable the name of the active user.

## **Record User**

The registration component is rendered on a page prepared to show it or the login component.

The logic used communicates with the back-end and through the User class, UserController and the IUserRepository interface manages the information and persists the data in the database (MySql), all through a Spring Boot.

        <b>&nbsp; Appointment CRUD</b>
    </summary>

## ü©∫&nbsp; Appointment

![Appointment](./readme_images/emr_appointment.gif)

The appointments section is the part where the patient appointments data is listed, created, edited and deleted. Here you can find information regarding each service performed.

The business rule here is based on two components in Angular. The first component (appointment) is responsible for presenting a list interface with inputs for searching and inserting new users. The second component (new-appointment) consists of a group of inputs that capture patient information.

There is a service in Angular (appointment.service.ts) responsible for making requests to the back-end (Spring) where it handles the information and returns the requested data.

Regarding the back-end responsible for the services, a Controller class (AppointmentController), a Model class (Appointment) and an interface responsible for the repository (IAppointmentRepository) are involved.

The Appointment class is a class that inherits another class MaturityLevel3Richardson, responsible for implementing the characteristics necessary for a maturity level 3 API. It also implements the attributes necessary for a service and is linked to the database so that the Controller can access and manipulate the data in the database.

The IAppointmentRepository interface inherits the JpaRepository which is responsible for implementing the complete API for CRUD.

In the AppointmentController class are the CRUD methods related to the calls, through which the HTTP actions are executed with their respective returns and Status. Through these methods the data in the database, in this case MySql, are manipulated as defined.

Regarding the back-end responsible for the services, a Controller class (PatientController), a Model class (Patient) and an interface responsible for the repository (IPatientRepository) are involved.

The Patient class is a class that inherits another MaturityLevel3Richardson class, responsible for implementing the necessary characteristics for a maturity level 3 API.

It also implements the attributes necessary for a service and is linked to the database so that the Controller can access and manipulate the data in the database.
